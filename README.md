## Changelog

### v1.0.2
* Added 195 gTLDs to the list, I wish I was making some of these up.
* Broke out the dictionary arrays into separate files. I need to add more words to the suggestion list.

### v1.0.1
* Changed the way the domain string is built
* Had internal conflicts about adding the protocol to the domain, too risky with unfurling

### v1.0.0
* Inital release
* Generates dumb domains from a dictionary of suggested names and gTLDs
* Totally didn't rip contents from dumb.domains
